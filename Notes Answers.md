
### 1. **`let` vs `var`** vs `const`
   - **`let`**: A keyword in JavaScript used to declare a block-scoped variable, meaning the variable is only accessible within the block it's defined in (e.g., within a function, loop, or conditional statement).
   - **`var`**: A keyword in JavaScript used to declare a function-scoped or globally-scoped variable. It does not adhere to block scope, meaning it can be accessed outside the block where it’s defined, leading to potential issues.
- `const` :In JavaScript, const is a keyword used to declare variables that are block-scoped, similar to variables declared using let, but with an important difference: variables declared with const cannot be reassigned. However, it is essential to note that const does not make the variable itself immutable, but rather the binding of the variable. This means that if a const variable holds an object or an array, the contents of that object or array can be modified.
### 2. **Asynchronous vs Synchronous**
   - **Synchronous**: Code is executed line by line, and each operation must complete before the next one begins. This can lead to blocking, where a task can hold up others until it's finished.
   - **Asynchronous**: Operations are executed independently of the main program flow, allowing other tasks to continue while waiting for one to complete. This is common in tasks like API calls, where you don't want to wait for a response before moving on.

### 3. **JSON vs Object**
   - **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)**: A lightweight data interchange format that's easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. It represents data as key-value pairs, similar to JavaScript objects, but in a string format.
   - **Object**: In programming, particularly JavaScript, an object is a collection of key-value pairs where the keys are strings, and the values can be any type (string, number, array, function, another object, etc.).

### 4. **Key-Value**
   - A **key-value** pair is a fundamental data representation where a specific key is used to retrieve a corresponding value. For example, in an object or dictionary, `"name": "John"` is a key-value pair where `"name"` is the key, and `"John"` is the value.

### 5. **Shallow Copy vs Deep Copy**
   - **Shallow Copy**: Copies the object's references, meaning changes to the original object will affect the copied object if the copied properties are objects themselves (like arrays or other objects).
   - **Deep Copy**: Creates a new instance of an object, including all objects nested within it. Changes to the original object do not affect the copied object.

### 6. **Spread Operator**
   - The **spread operator (`...`)** in JavaScript allows an iterable (like an array or string) to be expanded into individual elements. It's commonly used to copy arrays, combine arrays, or spread object properties into another object.

### 7. **ICANN**
   - **ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers)**: A nonprofit organization responsible for coordinating the maintenance and procedures of several databases related to the namespaces of the internet, ensuring the network's stable and secure operation.

### 8. **Public vs Private IP**
   - **Public IP**: An IP address that is accessible over the internet. It's used to identify devices on the public network.
   - **Private IP**: An IP address used within a private network, like a home or business network. It is not accessible from the internet.

### 9. **Protocols**
   - **Protocols** are rules and conventions for communication between network devices. Examples include **HTTP** (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) for web communication, **FTP** (File Transfer Protocol) for file transfers, and **TCP/IP** (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) for the overall internet communication structure.

### 10. **Main Domain and Subdomain**
   - **Main Domain**: The primary name of a website (e.g., `example.com`).
   - **Subdomain**: A subdivision of the main domain that acts as an additional part of the URL (e.g., `blog.example.com`).

### 11. **Ports**
   - **Ports** are virtual endpoints in a network that are used for communication. Each port is associated with a specific process or service. For example, **Port 80** is typically used for HTTP traffic, and **Port 443** is used for HTTPS traffic.

### 12. **DNS (Domain Name System)**
   - **DNS** is a hierarchical system that translates human-readable domain names (like `www.example.com`) into IP addresses that computers use to identify each other on the network.

### 13. **WHOIS**
   - **WHOIS** is a protocol and tool used to query databases to obtain information about the registration of a domain name, including the registrant's name, address, and the domain's availability.

### 14. **`JSON.parse`**
   - **`JSON.parse`** is a JavaScript method used to parse a JSON string and convert it into a JavaScript object.

### 15. **`JSON.copyObj`**
   - There is no direct method called `JSON.copyObj`, but a similar effect can be achieved using a combination of `JSON.stringify()` and `JSON.parse()` to create a deep copy of a JavaScript object.

### 16. **`structuredClone`**
   - **`structuredClone(object)`**: A method in JavaScript that creates a deep clone of an object, preserving the structure of nested objects, unlike shallow copies.

### 17. **UI & UX**
   - **UI (User Interface)**: The design and layout of an application's interface, focusing on aesthetics and the arrangement of elements like buttons, menus, and icons.
   - **UX (User Experience)**: Encompasses all aspects of a user's interaction with an application, focusing on the overall feel, ease of use, and satisfaction.

### 18. **Waterfall Model vs Agile**
   - **Waterfall Model**: A linear and sequential approach to software development where each phase must be completed before the next begins. It’s rigid and less adaptable to changes.
   - **Agile**: A flexible and iterative approach to software development that emphasizes collaboration, customer feedback, and small, rapid releases, allowing for continuous improvement and adaptability.
